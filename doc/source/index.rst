MySecureShell is a solution made to brings more features to sftp/scp protocol given by `OpenSSH <http://www.openssh.com/>`_. As by default, OpenSSH brings a lot of liberty to connected users which imply to thrust in your users. The goal of MySecureShell is to offer the power and security of OpenSSH, with enhanced features (like `ACL <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_control_list>`_) to restrict connected users.

MySecureShell was created because of the lack of file transfer features in OpenSSH. OpenSSH was not designed as a file transfer tool at first, that's why we brings those features into it.

MySecureShell is not a patch for OpenSSH, it's a shell for users. Easy to install, secure and easy to configure.
