Desktop clients

For the desktop clients solutions, here is what you can use as user:

========== ============= ===========
Plateform  Free          Proprietary
========== ============= ===========
Windows    WinSCP_       WebDrive_
\          FileZilla_
Mac OS     Cyberduck_    Transmit_
Linux      FileZilla_
\          gFTP_
========== ============= ===========

.. _Cyberduck: https://cyberduck.io/
.. _Transmit: http://panic.com/transmit/
.. _FileZilla: https://filezilla-project.org/
.. _WinSCP: http://winscp.net/
.. _WebDrive: http://www.webdrive.com/
.. _gFTP: http://gftp.seul.org/

All those solutions have been tested and works well. Of course a lot of others exists be we unfortunately didn't had the time to test them.
