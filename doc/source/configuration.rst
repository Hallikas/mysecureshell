Configuration
=============

To configure MySecureShell, you need to edit the */etc/ssh/sftp_config* file. By default MySecureSHell comes with a commented example configuration. This may not match all your needs and you will need to modify it to get it working as expected.

The configuration is made with 2 importants kinds of tags:

* Parent tags (level 1): defining a global context
* Child tags (level 2): defining a specific option for the parent tag
